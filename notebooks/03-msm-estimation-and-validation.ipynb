    "In this notebook, we have learned how to estimate a regular or Bayesian MSM from discretized molecular simulation data with `pyemma` and how to perform basic model validation.\n",
    "In detail, we have selected a suitable lag time by using\n",
    "- `pyemma.msm.its()` to obtain an implied timescale object and\n",
    "- `pyemma.plots.plot_implied_timescales()` to visualize the convergence of the implied timescales.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then have used\n",
    "- `pyemma.msm.estimate_markov_model()` to estimate a regular MSM,\n",
    "- `pyemma.msm.bayesian_markov_model()` to estimate a Bayesian MSM,\n",
    "- the `timescales()` method of an estimated MSM object to access its implied timescales,\n",
    "- the `cktest()` method of an estimated MSM object to perform a Chapman-Kolmogorow test, and\n",
    "- `pyemma.plots.plot_cktest()` to visualize the latter.\n",
